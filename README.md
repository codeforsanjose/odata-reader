# OData-Reader
This project was born out of [this](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/Project-Ideas/issues/86) issue posted in project ideas.

What it does is reads the San Jose web service that returns in OData format, converts this into a json object that can than be used for multiple types of data visualizations (Table w/ sortable columns) and then allows the user to download the data in CSV format.
